## Order Mannagment Page

### New Order

The user can add an order, Every order will have a unique id. The id of the orders keeps going even if the order has already been deleted.
The New Order page is fully responsive and when the "New Order" form is unvisible - a FAB "add" button will be shown.

### Edit Order

When the user clicks on "Edit Order" button the Edit Order page will be shown.
After editing the order and clicking the "Update" button the order will be updated and the main page will be shown.

I have remained consistent in the design that fits your web page.
